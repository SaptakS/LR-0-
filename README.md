# LR0 Parsing Table

This is a project containing various codes related to LR(0) parsing along with the code for firstset and followset. The folder grammar contains some sample grammars for testing. You can also input your own grammar rules.

* __finalclosures.py__ - Find the closures for the various itemsets along with their transitions.
* __gen_table.py__ - Generate LR(0) table. [Work under progress. Would be happy if someone would like to contribute]
* __parse_input.py__- Check for acceptance of a string depending on the grammar rule
